There are text input area, add button, and cancel button.

You can add new items by clicking button or pressing Enter key.

Also, you can remove the modal by cancel button or clicking outside of modal layer.

## 2. Toggle Items

There are list on the page. You can easily toggle to click them once.

## 3. Clear Items

There are two clear buttons to clear each components.

Clear Complete button will remove completed items only.

Clear All button will remove all items.

## 4. Save

In this page, all activities without open or close modal will save the list in your local storage with the tag "toDos".

So you can meet the last list that you changed when you open this page if items in local storage didn't removed.

If you clear all list and open later, then initial example items will appear.
